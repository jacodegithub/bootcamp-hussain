        <h2>Open System Interconnection (OSI) Model Layers</h2>
        <p>The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to understand and describe network communication between computing systems. It consists of seven layers, each serving specific functions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physical Layer : </strong>Responsible for the physical connection between devices and the transmission of raw bits over a communication channel.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Link Layer : </strong>Handles the reliable transfer of data frames between nodes over a physical layer connection.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Layer : </strong>Manages the addressing and routing of data packets between different networks.</li>
            <li><strong>Transport Layer : </strong>Ensures the reliable and efficient delivery of data between endpoints, handling issues such as congestion control and data integrity.</li>
            <li><strong>Session Layer : </strong>Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections between applications on different network devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Presentation Layer : </strong>Handles the translation, encryption, and compression of data for effective transmission across different systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Application Layer : </strong>Provides network services to user applications and enables communication between end-user software and the network.</li>
        </ul>
