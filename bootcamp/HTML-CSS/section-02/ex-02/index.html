        A character encoding is a system that assigns a unique binary code to each character in a set of characters. Various character encodings, such as ASCII, Unicode, and UTF-8, facilitate the representation of text in different languages and scripts, including Latin, Cyrillic, Chinese, and many more. ASCII, a basic character encoding, uses 7 bits to represent characters, accommodating English and other Western languages. Unicode, an expansive encoding standard, employs 8, 16, or 32 bits, allowing the representation of a vast range of characters, symbols, and scripts from various languages and writing systems. UTF-8, a variable-width encoding, is widely used for web pages and email, supporting the entire Unicode character set while maintaining backward compatibility with ASCII. Understanding different character encodings is crucial for ensuring accurate and comprehensive text representation, enabling seamless communication and content display across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.
