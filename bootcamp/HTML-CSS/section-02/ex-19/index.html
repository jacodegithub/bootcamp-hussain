    <h1>Pathaan</h1>
    <h3>Yash Raj Films Presents</h3>
    <h4>About : </h4>
    <p>
        Shah Rukh Khan is Pathaan in this action-filled movie, and, at the beginning of the film, he has been called back to work with the Indian government after retiring. The premise for this is the fact that the Indian government has recalled Article 370, which revoked Kashmirâ€™s special status, and a group called Outfit X is planning to attack the President of India while at a science conference abroad. Behind the scenes, a vengeful Pakistani general has decided to hire a guy named Jim, who leads Outfit X, to get revenge for the fact Article 370 was revoked.
